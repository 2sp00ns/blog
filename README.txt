    Repository Structure:
        Root Directory (/): This directory contains the main files for your blog, including the homepage (index.html), CSS stylesheets (styles.css), JavaScript files (scripts.js), and any other assets.
        Posts Directory (/posts): Create a directory to store individual HTML files for each blog post. Each post should be named descriptively, preferably following a consistent naming convention like YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.html.
        Assets Directory (/assets): Store images, videos, or any other media files used in your blog posts.
        Other Directories: You may create additional directories as needed for organizing resources or specific types of content.

    Homepage (index.html):
        Your homepage serves as the main landing page for your blog. It can feature a list of recent blog posts, summaries, or any other content you want visitors to see first.

    Individual Blog Post Pages:
        Each blog post should have its own HTML file within the /posts directory.
        Follow a consistent template for blog post pages, including headers, titles, publication dates, content, and any additional metadata you wish to include.
        Consider using HTML metadata like <meta> tags for SEO optimization and social media sharing.

    Navigation:
        Implement a navigation system to allow users to navigate between the homepage and individual blog posts.
        You can use HTML links or navigation elements to facilitate navigation.

    Process for Adding New Posts:
        To add a new post, create a new HTML file within the /posts directory and populate it with the content of your blog post.
        Make sure each post follows the same HTML structure and styling to maintain consistency across your blog.

    Version Control with Git:
        Utilize Git for version control to track changes, manage revisions, and collaborate with others if necessary.
        Regularly commit changes to your repository and use meaningful commit messages to document updates and improvements.

    Deployment:
        Once you make changes or add new posts, push your changes to your GitHub repository.
        GitHub Pages can host your static HTML files directly from your repository, making deployment easy and straightforward.

    Domain Management:
        Ensure your custom domain is correctly configured to point to your GitHub Pages site.
        Verify that your domain settings are up-to-date and any changes you make are reflected in your DNS configuration.

By following this structured approach, you can create and manage a scalable blog using HTML pages in your GitHub repository. This setup allows for easy addition of new posts, efficient management of content, and seamless integration with your custom domain for online access.
